## üìå Project Objective
> Successfully onboard a Windows 10 virtual machine to Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE), practice isolating the device from the network, and collect an investigation package for endpoint forensics.

---

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies
- **Platform:** Azure
- **OS:** Windows 10
- **Tools:** Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Azure VM, PowerShell
- **Languages/Scripts:** Windows GUI, CLI

---

## üß† Skills Gained / Focus Areas
- Onboarded a VM to MDE and verified success
- Isolated a device using the MDE portal
- Collected and inspected forensic investigation packages
- Practiced proactive security measures and incident response

---

## üß™ Environment Setup
> Provisioned a secure Windows 10 VM in Azure. Downloaded and installed the MDE onboarding package using administrator privileges. Configured network and firewall rules to support testing and isolation behavior.

2. [Step 2: Isolate the VM](#step-2-isolate-the-vm)
3. [Step 3: Collect an Investigation Package](#step-3-collect-an-investigation-package)

---

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Onboard the VM
> - Created a Windows 10 VM in Azure with secure credentials  
> - Logged into the [Microsoft Defender portal](https://security.microsoft.com)  
> - Navigated to: **Settings ‚Üí Endpoints ‚Üí Device Management ‚Üí Onboarding**  
> - Downloaded the Windows 10/11 MDE onboarding package (provided by admin)  
> - Installed the package inside the VM (Right-click ‚Üí Run as Administrator)  
> - Verified onboarding success at **Assets ‚Üí Devices**

---

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Isolate the VM
> - Turned off Windows Firewall (`wf.msc`)  
> - Modified NSG to allow inbound ICMP  
> - Started a ping loop from an external device to the VM‚Äôs public IP  
> - Logged into MDE Portal ‚Üí **Assets ‚Üí Devices**  
> - Selected the VM ‚Üí Clicked 3-dot menu ‚Üí Chose ‚ÄúIsolate Device‚Äù  
> - Observed the ping drop due to isolation  
> - Later: released the device from isolation for continued use

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Collect an Investigation Package
> - In MDE Portal: **Assets ‚Üí Devices**  
> - Selected device ‚Üí Clicked 3-dot menu ‚Üí ‚ÄúCollect Investigation Package‚Äù  
> - Entered a comment and confirmed  
> - Viewed progress in the **Action Center**  
> - Once completed, downloaded the package  
> - Unzipped and inspected artifacts such as logs, memory, registry, and binaries
